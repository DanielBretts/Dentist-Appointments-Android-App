    <string name="doctor_details">My name is Dr. Yaacob Brettschneider. I was born in Haifa, Israel, in 1964. I graduated in 1991 from the Yassy Dental School in Romania. My entire childhood was spent in the light of the dental profession. My uncle, was a dentist in Bat Yam until the day he died in 1981. My father, Max Brettschneider, was a dentist also. The dental clinic was part of our home for over 45 years. In 1992 I opened my dental clinic in Kiryat Motzkin and  to this day the clinic serves my patients in a personal and warm way till this day. In 2018, the field of facial aesthetics was added to the practice and I perform aesthetic treatments.</string>
